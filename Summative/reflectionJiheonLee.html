                    Why is it important for high school students to learn programming?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Programming requires logical and problem-solving mind to build an efficient algorithm according to the need of the writer. 
                    Even if some of the students are not interested in computer science, it is important to establish a funcdamental knowledge in programming 
                    to grow mathmetical and logical thinking skills in adolescent where a brain is developed the fastest in one's life. Moreover, most of the industry present in the world
                    is evolving with a computational technology, and it is inevitable to operate computers or electronic devices in workplaces after high school students grow up.
                    Therefore, it is important to learn programming not only for the students pursuing that field but also all other students.

                <div class="question">
                    What made the work difficult? What were the easy parts?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Part that made the work difficult is the compatibility between CSS and JavaScript. 
                    While manipulating styles with JavaScript, it often cause a crash with existing CSS styles of the previous styles manipulated through JavaScript.
                    Thus, I need to analyze both CSS and JavaScript algorithm to solve the problems.
                    Moreover, I designed the webpages as much responsive as possible. In the course of making a responsive design, I should test various combination of CSS properties and values. This work took a lot of time and effort to successfully acheive the responsive webpages.
                    Another thing was the algorithms in clock operation. Since each digit of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes changes a digit at different numbers, I had to design an efficient algorithms to
                    check all the cases and change corresponding elements in HTML. <br>
                    After completeing the clock and flashcards, the ToDo List came to be easier than the previous tasks. With some transition effects, I could easily create several functions to manipulate the items in the list.
                    Because It doesn't require a complex code for the operation like the clock, It was the easy part of the summative project.

                <div class="question">
                    How can I use what I learned in this course in the future?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Although I am not considering to pursue web developing, a website as a medium is highly appreciable. Websites possess exceptionally high accessibility and legibility
                    to appeal myself to public. Therefore, I could build a website for the portfolio of my career. Using JavaScript I learned in this course and incorporating the sense of visual design,
                    I could create a responsive portfolio of my skills developed through post-secondary education and work experiences.

                <div class="question">
                    If I were to have more time, what would I improve on my project?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    In my opinion, there are not many things to improve functionally, but I would improve visual aspect of my project.
                    If I had more time to work on, I would have meticulously design the pages considering the arrangement of buttons and interfaces.
                    As a result, I could create more visually pleasing website with more completeness.
                    Also, I want to contemplate the code and algorithm I wrote for each task and contrive more efficient and simpler solution for the project.

                <h2 class="withLine"><span>Daily Log</span></h2>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 12</h3>
                    <p>It is the first day working on my summative project. I designed the interface of digital clock to incorporate multiple pieces of date information in a window clearly. After finishing designing the clock, I build HTML and CSS. There were difficulties in arrange multiple elements with different sizes in a lectangular box. Besides, I used auto for overflow property of the box to make the clock responsive as the window size changes. I also completed JavaScript code for the first part of the digital clock, the real-time clock. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 13</h3>
                    <p>I spent a whole day to build a JavaScript code for the timer and the alarm. There was a difficultes and some errors in displaying the input of digits on the alarm and in resuming the alarm. I solved this problem by updating both the input string and total second as global variables every second, so that the time can be synchronized.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 14</h3>
                    <p>I changed the subject of the second task from a notepad to flashcards. The reason is that there are difficulties in the implementation of a dragable and flexible typing space and style manipulation of texts. Moreover, the general purpose of notepad can be alike with the purpose of the third task, the ToDo List. Therefore, I changed my mind to build flashcards.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 18</h3>
                    <p>I finished working on Javascript of flashcards. There were not much difficulties in JavaScript because there are only few functions to manipulate the cards. However, there were a lot of things to consider about dispalying the cards when the button is clicked. For example, whenever a card is deleted or the user move on to the next card, I had to consider the conditions of current cards to execute appropriate algorithms.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 19</h3>
                    <p>I started working on the code of the third task, the ToDo List. I adopted a different design of a list to increase the uniqueness in visual design. There was a difficulty in maintaining values of input fields after adding a new item and update HTML code with JavaScript. I solve this problem by creating an array to store the values of all input fields of every item, then overwrite the data after adding a new item. Besides, I wrote additional functions for deleting, undoing, (un)checking all, and clearing all. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 20</h3>
                    <p>I added trasition effects with CSS and JavaScript. I believe these animations can improve the project in the sense of responsive web design. Using trasition effects on width and opacity, I was able to create dynamic visual effects on my summative project.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="log">
                    <h3>February 21</h3>
                    <p>I made small changes in flowchards to finalize the project and wrote HTML and CSS for the proposal and the reflection pages. Lastly, I checked the programs of the three tasks again if there is no errors.</p>
