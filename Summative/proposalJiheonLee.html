                The Study Helper contains three main functions to assist students' study life in a efficient and visual way.<br>
                With the Digital Clock including a stopwatch and an alarm, it suggests an alternative timing tool instead of a phone.<br>
                With the Flashcards, it efficiently helps students memorize various types of questions.<br>
                With the ToDo List, it allows students organize their daily schedule and help planning tasks.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows how the clock works.<br>
                            Once the start button is clicked, the function will executed every 1 second.<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the function, it first get the information of current day, hour, minute, and second.
                            To format the hour which is in 24 hours, ut determines the period using the conditional and the remainder of hours divided by 12.
                            Then, ut connects the strings of hours, minutes, and seconds to display on the clock.
                            Lastly, it displays day and period on the clock.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows the basic operation of the stopwatch.<br>
                            Once the start button is clicked, it initialize an array of 8 digits, which is on the page.
                            Then, the function is called every 10 milliseconds.<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith a loop iterating the last 7 digits of the array, it checkes if any digit turns to 10.
                            If so, it resets the digit to 0 and increases the next digit by 1.
                            Similarly, the loop iterates from the tenth digit of seconds to the tenth digit of minutes to check if any digit turns to 6.
                            If so, it resets the digit to 0 and increases the next digit by 1.
                            After checking them, it increases the last digit, the oneth digit of millisecond, by 1 to make the stopwatch flow.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows the basic operation of the alarm.<br>
                            First, the program gets a string of a series of digits from user input.
                            With this input, the function divides it into three parts - hours, minutes, and seconds.
                            Then, it multiplies 3600 to the hours and 60 to the minutes to calculate the total seconds by adding the values.
                            After determining the total seconds left, it calls the function every 1 second.<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the function, the total seconds decreases by 1, and the function convert this total seconds into a six-digit string.
                            Then, it displays the updated string on the page.
                            Meanwhile, when the total seconds was calculated, it automatically countdowns and rings the alarm as well as flashes the background at last.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows how cards are added to flashcards.<br>
                            When the user enter a question ans an answer, the function push the values in two arrays for questions and answers.<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThen, it increases the integer variable of total number of cards by 1 and changes the number of current card to show to the last number.
                            For the next input, it resets the input fields and closes the element.
                            Finally, it display the newly added card with the question and the answer stored in the arrays.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows how cards are deleted from flashcards.<br>
                            First, the program goes through a conditional to check if the number of cards is greater than 0 (if there is at least one card).
                            If it passes the condition, it deletes the question and the answer of currently displayed card from the arrays.
                            Then, it decreases the total length of a sequence by 1. <br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf the current card was the last card, it decreases the current number by 1, which will be the number of the last card.
                            If the total length is 0, which means there is no card left, it chooses a random emoji and display that there is no card.
                            If not, it displays the current card with a question and updates the current page number and the total page number at the bottom of the page.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis flowchart shows how new items are added to the ToDo list.<br><br>
                    When the 'plus' button is clicked, the program increases the variable of number of items by 1.
                    Then, it calls the function to save the input values before updating HTML.<br><br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the following function, it initialize an empty array to store the values.
                    After declaring variables to get elements of title, description, and checkbox from HTML, it starts a loop for the items in the ToDo List.
                    For every items, the function push an array of values from input fields of title and description and the status of checkbox as a boolean into the array created earlier.<br><br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThen, the program append the formatted HTML for an item to the container. Using a fade-in transition, it displays the new item in the list.
                    Lastly, the program calls the function to overwrite the saved values on the initialized input fields of every item.
                    This function also loops all the items in the list to write the value with the data collected in the array during the previous function.
                    After it writes all the values of items, the program ends adding a new item.
